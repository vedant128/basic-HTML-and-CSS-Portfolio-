        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Vedant Gunjal, an aspiring IT engineer with a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python, along with in-depth knowledge of Data Structures. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Information Technology, I combine my technical skills with a creative flair as the Graphic Design Lead for Google Developer Groups (GDG).
            <br>
            I am deeply passionate about technology, innovation, and design. My interests lie in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to develop impactful solutions that address real-world challenges. With a keen eye for detail and a collaborative mindset, I strive to blend aesthetics and functionality in all my projects.
            <br>
            Driven by curiosity and a commitment to growth, I continuously explore new tools, techniques, and trends in the IT and design domains. My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech community while empowering others through my work.</p>
